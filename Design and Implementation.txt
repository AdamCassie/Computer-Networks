For Section 2 of the Text Conferencing Lab, we implemented the following functionalities-
(1) Inactivity timer (in which clients are logged out from server after being inactive
    for a pre-defined amount of time.
(2) Invites (in which a client can invite second client to join a session to which the 
    first client belongs.

Below is an outline of our design and implementation of each functionality.


Inactivity timer-

The server opens a thread which continuously compares the current time with each client's 
'last active time' (ie. the time at which the client last communicated with the server). 
This last active time for each client is thus updated everytime the client communicates with
the server (eg. by issuing a command or sending a message).

When the difference between the current time and a client's last active time exceeds the
maximum inactivity time (see #define MAX_TIME in server.c) that client is logged out by server.


Invites-

If a client belongs to a session, it can invite other logged in clients to that session by
issuing a command of the form:

/invite <client id> <session id>

(where client id is refers to the client to which the invite should be sent, and session id
refers to the session for which this client is being invited).

The client which receives the invitation can issue one of the following commands to accept or
reject the invitation accordingly:

/accept
/reject

If the invitation is accepted, the server will remove the client from any session to which it 
already belonged, and add the client to the session for which it was invited.
